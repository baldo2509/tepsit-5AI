### Projects created during my TEPSIT course at ITIS Marconi, Pontedera

Each exercise will be a branch of this repo; for exercises with multiple projects each
exercise will be a directory in the branch. This isn't _great_ as far as organization
goes, but in my opinion it doesn't make that much sense to make an individual repo for
simple projects that will be worked on once or twice and then abandoned..

if needed i'll fork each branch i guess :/
