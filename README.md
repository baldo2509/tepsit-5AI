### Projects created during my TEPSIT course at ITIS Marconi, Pontedera

Each exercise/project will be a branch of this repo (which for exercises with multiple projects
will have a sub-branch for each project), which isn't _great_ as far as organization
goes, but in my opinion it doesn't make that much sense to make an individual repo for
simple projects that will be worked on once or twice and then abandoned..

if needed i'll fork each branch i guess :/
