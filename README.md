### Projects created during my TEPSIT course at ITIS Marconi, Pontedera

Each project will be a directory in the repo. This is a _bad_ way of doing a repo, but in my opinion it doesn't make that much sense to make individual repos for
simple projects that will be worked on once or twice and then abandoned..

if needed i'll do a bunch of forks i guess :/
